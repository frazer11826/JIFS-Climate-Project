Data 422 Project | Climate Change and Population

**Overview**

This dataset was created with the aim of addressing the reasons people move around New Zealand, and whether there is a relation between the changing natural landscape and where people choose to reside.​

The data consists of two separate data-frames.​

The historical measurements are for earthquakes, internal migration, and weather (rainfall, temperature, and wind gusts), covering the years 2014-17 (inclusive).​

The second dataset is for searise in these regions covering predictions for a range of scenarios out to 2300. The prediction to be examined can be changed via a function.
